Flag	Function	Why use it?

--read-only	
Mounts the container's root filesystem as read-only.	
Prevents attackers from modifying system files or installing malware inside the container.

-v /tmp	
Creates a Volume for /tmp.	
If the app needs to write logs or cache, it needs a place to write since the rest of the disk is locked.

--tmpfs /tmp	
Mounts /tmp into RAM (Host Memory).
Files in /tmp are never written to the disk and vanish when the container stops. This is faster and more secure.

-d	
Detached mode.	
Runs the container in the background so you can keep using your terminal.

-p 8080:80	
Port Mapping.	
Forwards traffic from your computer's port 8080 to the container's port 80.
