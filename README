1️⃣ Start with the Project Overview
You can say something like:

“I built a multi-container Docker project with frontend, backend, and PostgreSQL database to demonstrate end-to-end containerization in a production-ready setup.
The goal was to create a scalable, maintainable, and secure environment that could run anywhere, including EC2.”

Key points to highlight:

Multi-service architecture

Docker Compose orchestration

Use of healthchecks and volumes for reliability



2️⃣ Describe the Architecture

Refer to your diagram:

“Here’s the architecture:

Frontend (React app) runs in its container, exposed on port 8080.

Backend (Node.js API) runs in a separate container on port 5000.

PostgreSQL database runs in its own container, exposed on 5432.

Persistent logs are handled via a Docker-managed named volume, so logs survive container restarts.

The frontend waits for backend health checks to avoid 404 errors.”



3️⃣ Talk About the Challenges & Solutions

“While building this, I encountered real-world challenges:

Permission errors (EACCES) writing logs:

The backend was running as a non-root user inside the container.

Initially, we tried a bind-mounted host folder for logs, but Node.js couldn’t write because of UID/GID mismatches.

Solution: We switched to a Docker-managed named volume and ensured proper ownership inside the container.

Alpine user creation issues:

Hardcoding UID 1000 failed because Alpine already uses that UID.

Solution: Created a system user with automatic UID, avoiding conflicts.

Service startup order:

Frontend sometimes started before backend was ready.

Solution: Used depends_on with healthchecks to orchestrate startup reliably.”


4️⃣ Highlight Enterprise Practices

Interviewers like hearing real-world production practices, for example:

Non-root containers for security

Multi-stage Dockerfile for smaller, production-ready images

Healthchecks and depends_on for reliable startup

Named Docker volumes for persistent logs

Port mappings and environment variables via .env file

You can phrase it as:

“This project is designed like a real enterprise setup: secure, reliable, and maintainable.”
